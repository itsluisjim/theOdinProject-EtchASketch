# Etch-A-Sketch

The sketch pad project, a part of The Odin Project curriculum, was built utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a grid composed of customizable squares that change color when hovered over. The project allowed me to refine my skills with CSS selectors and event listeners, which are essential in web development. Additionally, the sketch pad offers the option to clear the canvas and adjust the grid size.
